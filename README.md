# 1. Prior production experience with JavaScript?

I have deployed my own code to DigitalOcean something like two dozen times. I am familiar with Ubuntu 20.04 and Nginx because of it. I probably couldn't deploy Ureeqa's code, but I sure can deploy my own!

You asked for a time span: Probably about a year and a half, starting with simple index.html and js, building up to a full stack application after several months.

# 2. Production experience with JS frameworks prior to submission?

Yes, I've worked with React since September of 2019, almost all active time. That makes almost 3 years.

I've also worked with Vue enough that I could be up and running with it inside of two weeks.

Angular, however, is somewhat of a steep learning curve. I probably would need a month to learn that.

I know nothing about jQuery except that it is apparently going out of style.
